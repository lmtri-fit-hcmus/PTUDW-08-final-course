            <p>Global agriculture has until now experienced two major technological revolutions; that is, the Green
                Revolution and its successor, the Gene Revolution. The term “Green Revolution”
                was coined in 1968 to describe the phenomenal growth in agriculture.(1)
                It involved the application of science to increase agricultural growth, principally through the use
                of breeding techniques to produce high-yield varieties (HYVs). These HYVs, together with the
                increased use of pesticides and fertilizers, improved irrigation, mechanization, and also soil
                conservation by less use of machinery and ultimately resulted in the remarkable growth in
                agriculture experienced.(2) During this period, food production increased significantly,(3,4)
                remarkably for rice in Asia, maize in Mesoamerica and some parts of Africa and Asia, and wheat in
                irrigated and suitable areas all over the world.(2) A combination of highrate investment in
                infrastructure and market development, research, and suitable policies jointly fueled land
                productivity. These factors resulted in higher growth and land values.(5) However, the declining
                trend of agricultural growth in the decades before 1995 constitutes a reduction in growth within
                several high-income countries, particularly in Japan and Western Europe.(6)

                The use of biotechnology, especially genetic engineering technology, in agriculture to combat food
                insecurity and hunger in turn generated the Gene Revolution.(7−12) The gene
                revolution resulted in the mass production of crops with altered genes generally known as
                “genetically
                modified organisms” (GMOs). These GMOs have genes that have been
                modified using genetic engineering techniques to tolerate pests and herbicides and drought and also
                to
                improve the growth of the plant.
                Although GM technology was promoted as a tool to make a significant change to the overall
                sustainability
                of agricultural food production systems worldwide, some practical evidence has generated conflicting
                outcomes.(13) GM technology is seen by some to have positive effects on biodiversity, since the
                sequencing of genomes provides capacity for selective breeding of crops suited to diverse ecologies.
                This implies that GM technology augments nature’s diversity and also expands adaptive
                capabilities.(14)
                Opponents of GM technology argue that farmers in developing countries, especially small-scale
                farmers,
                have problems that are specific to their economic, cultural, and environmental conditions. Hence,
                the
                spillover from private sector research in developed countries has therefore had limited impact on
                the
                livelihoods of subsistence farmers in developing countries who produce most of the world’s food.(15)
                The
                creation of GM crops may attract investment in agriculture, but it can also concentrate ownership of
                agricultural resources. Hence, it remains questionable whether this branch of science can really
                improve
                the situation of small-scale farmers(3,16) who hold about 500 million small farms and support almost
                2
                billion people—one third of humanity.(17) Consequently, the technology has stimulated of debate over
                its
                ecological, technological, political, socioeconomic, and legal aspects, especially in developing
                countries.(12,59) Hence, it remains questionable whether GM crops can result in a revolution towards
                “agricultural development” and “sustainability” or make only a significant change in “agricultural
                growth.”
